# Job-Scam-Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to detect fraudulent job postings using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help job seekers identify and avoid scam job listings, ensuring a safer job search experience.

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes various features of job postings. The data was sourced from [Kaggleâ€™s Real or Fake Job Posting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction). 
Preprocessing steps include removing null and duplicate values, cleaning text data, and feature engineering.

## Methodology
The project uses Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic regression and Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of a job posting being a scam. 
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 93%. Details of the findings and model comparison are documented within the Jupyter Notebook.
